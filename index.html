        <h2>Top Strange Events</h2>
        <p>Nature is really weird, but also beautiful at the same time. We have compiled the most beautiful of them. Below are some of them:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Raining Fish – Honduras has fish "falling" from the sky.</li>
            <li>Fire Rainbows – Rare halos of light created by sunlight and ice crystals.</li>
            <li>Bioluminescent Beaches – Glowing waves caused by tiny plankton in the water.</li>
            <li>Snow Rollers – Naturally-formed snow cylinders that roll across fields.</li>
            <li>Catatumbo Lightning – Lightning storms that occur almost every night in Venezuela.</li>

        <h2>Images of These Phenomena</h2>

        <p id="text">
            One such rare phenomenon that we encountered was the raining fish phenomenon. This occurs when strong winds such as those from tornadoes or waterspouts get small fish from bodies of water adn then disperse them to other places when the winds weaken. The Rain of Fish occurs in Honduras and it is religiously attributed. The local people have a legend and it is mythologized even though it can be explained by nature. </p>

        <p id="text">We also encountered something really interesting called a fire rainbow. This is a phenomenon in which is scientifically called "circumhorizontal arc" occurs when sunlight bends and refracts by going through ice crystals in high altitude clouds called cirrus clouds. It looks like a colorful rainbow in the sky and it often looks fiery which is where it's nickname is derived from. The sun has to be really high in the sky (58 degrees above the horizon) to actually form and the ice crystals must be in a specific orientation.  </p>

        <p id="text">The bioluminsecent beach is when tiny organisms, most of which are called dinoflagellates, in the lake or ocean emit light when they are moved. THe light is caused by a chemical reaction that occurs in the organismm and is caused by movement through waves or even from swimmers and boats. It is usually used as a defense mechanism, making the predators get scared or startled. </p>

        <p id="text"> A snow roller is a rare occurrence when balls of snow are formed when wind blows and it rolls down a hill or mountain. The snow is usually sticky and moist on the ground when they roll and pick up more and more as they roll further. The conditions have to be perfect. There has to be a thin layer of loose, wet snow on top of an icy or hard surface and just enough wind to get the snow rolling. </p>

        <p id="text"> This weird type of lightning is called Catatumbo lightning and its a rare phenomenon that usually happens in Venezuela near the Catatumbo river which flows into Lake Maracaibo. The Carribean air collides with the cold air from the mountains. This causes a lot of thunderstorms that have up to 280 flashes per hour.</p>

        <p id="text"> Lastly, the northern lights, scientifically called aurora borealis, are a display of natural lights that are caused by electrically charged particles from the sun that interact with the Earth's atmosphere at the top. THe magnetic field of the eart moves the particles toward the poles. The particles interact with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air. This causes them to emit light in many colors like green, red, blue and purple. </p>
