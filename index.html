        <h2>Images of These Phenomena</h2>
        <img src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/honduras-fish-rain.jpg" alt="Raining Fish">
        <p id="text">The "raining fish" phenomenon is a rare meteorological event caused by strong winds, like those in waterspouts or tornadoes, that suck up small fish from bodies of water and then drop them elsewhere as the winds subside. While often attributed to a natural explanation, it is also sometimes mythologized, such as the case of "Lluvia de Peces" (Rain of Fish) in Yoro, Honduras, which local lore links to a 19th-century priest's prayers. </p>

        <p id="text">A "fire rainbow" is an atmospheric phenomenon called a circumhorizontal arc, which occurs when sunlight refracts through ice crystals in high-altitude cirrus clouds. It appears as a colorful, rainbow-like band in the sky, often with a fiery appearance that gives it its nickname. To form, the sun must be very high in the sky (at least 58 degrees above the horizon) and the ice crystals must be in a specific plate-like orientation. </p>

        <p id="text">The bioluminescent beach phenomenon occurs when tiny marine organisms, primarily dinoflagellates, emit light when agitated. This light is the result of a chemical reaction that can be triggered by movement from waves, swimmers, or even boats. It can serve as a defensive mechanism, startling potential predators or attracting larger ones that might prey on the organisms that disturb them.</p>
        <img src="https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Snow_roller_2" alt="Snow Roller">
        <p id="text">Snow rollers are a rare natural phenomenon where large, cylindrical balls of snow are formed when wind blows chunks of sticky, moist snow along the ground, causing them to roll and pick up more snow. This requires a precise combination of specific conditions: a thin layer of loose, wet snow on top of an icy or hard surface, and just enough wind to get the snow rolling without blowing it apart. </p>
        <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lightning_0.jpg?w=1304" alt="Catatumbo Lightning">
        <p id="text">Catatumbo lightning is a unique atmospheric phenomenon in Venezuela, occurring at the mouth of the Catatumbo River where it flows into Lake Maracaibo. It is the result of a specific geographic formation that causes warm, moist air from the Caribbean to collide with cool mountain air, creating a constant source of thunderstorms with up to 280 flashes per hour, notes SKYbrary Aviation Safety and BBC. This continuous lightning has earned the area the title of the world's lightning capital.</p>

        <p id="text">The northern lights (aurora borealis) are a natural light display caused by electrically charged particles from the sun colliding with gases in Earth's upper atmosphere. Earth's magnetic field redirects these particles toward the poles, where they interact with oxygen and nitrogen, causing them to emit light in various colors like green, red, blue, and purple. </p>
